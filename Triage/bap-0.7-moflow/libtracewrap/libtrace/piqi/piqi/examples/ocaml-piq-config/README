This is an example of how to use configuration file in Piq format from OCaml
program.

This example requires the "piqi.lib" ocamlfind package. Refer to
../../INSTALL.ocaml for instructions how to build and install it.

To build the example, run "make". Alternatively, you can use the "build.sh"
script, it contains explicit build commands.

The resulting "./config" executable will read the config data structure from
"config.piq" and print it on stdout.


Files:
        config.piqi - the definition of the config file format
        config.piq  - an example config file
        config.ml   - an OCaml program that reads the "config.piq" file

======================================================
ViewGraph is now deprecated. Prefer to use dgraph now.
======================================================

ViewGraph is a small ocaml library that helps to view a graph from a dot file
in a Lablgtk canvas, and interact with it. 

To have more information :
  make doc
and browse the documentation starting from doc/index.html

You can also compile the test file, and try to use it :
  make; ./viewgraph file.dot

* What is estring

Estring is a syntax extension which aims to make the use of custom
string types more convenient.

The idea is to replace code like that:

  (My_string.of_string "string literals")

by that:

  m"string literals"

* Requirement

Estring needs ocaml >= 3.11.

* Building and installation

To build and install estring just type:

  $ make all
  $ make install

This will install the estring package (ocamlfind is required).

* How to use it

Files in the "sample" directory show how to define string convertors.

For the distribution of your project, you can either add a dependency
to the estring package or embed it in your sources. Several instances
of estring can work together so this will not break anything.

* Development

The last development version of estring can always be found in the
darcs repository hosted at darcs.ocamlcore.org:

  $ darcs get http://darcs.ocamlcore.org/repos/estring/estring

local variables:
mode: outline

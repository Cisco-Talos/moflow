\section{Overview}

The \bap infrastructure is implemented in C++ and OCaml.  The lifting
and back-end is implemented in OCaml. The C++ portions of BAP
interface with GNU BFD for parsing executable objects, and GNU
libopcodes for pretty-printing the disassembly. Each disassembled
instruction is lifted to the IL by OCaml code, and then passed to the
back-end.  We interface the C++ front-end with the OCaml back-end
using OCaml via IDL generated stubs.


The \bap top-level directory structure is:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf libasmir:} This directory contains all the code that
  interfaces which parses binary file formats.

\item {\bf ocaml:} This directory contains the core \bap library and
  routines. All the code is written in ocaml. Only core \bap code
  should go on this directory. If you must modify it in a
  project-specific way, please make a project-specific branch for
  those changes.

\item {\bf utils:} This contains user utilities, again written in OCaml.

\item {\bf doc:} The directory containing this documentation.
\end{itemize}

\bap  is designed to facilitate faithful
security-relevant binary program analysis by 1) reducing complex
instruction sets to a single, small, and formally specified
intermediate language that supports writing  concise,
easy-to-understand analyses 2) providing a set of core program analyses
abstractions, and 3) being architecture independent when possible in
order to support easy re-targeting.


Figure~\ref{fig:vine-components} shows a high-level picture of \bap.
\bap is divided into an architecture-specific front-end and an
architecture-independent back-end.  At the core of \bap is an
architecture-independent intermediate language (IL), called \emph{\bil,} for
assembly. Assembly instructions in the underlying architecture are
lifted up to the \bil via the \bap front-end.  All analyses are
performed on the platform-independent \bil in the back-end.
%Thus, program analysis can be
%written in an architecture-independent fashion.

We lift to the \bil by using open-source utilities to parse the binary
format and produce assembly.  The assembly is then lifted up to the
\bap IL in a syntax-directed manner. The \bap front-end currently
supports lifting usermode x86~\cite{intel:x86} code, though other
architectures may be added to the \bap framework.
% and ARMv4~\cite{arm:armv4} to the IL.

The \bap back-end supports a variety of core program analyses
and utilities.  The back-end has utilities for creating a variety of
different graphs, such as control flow and program dependence graphs.
The back-end also provides an optimization framework. The optimization
framework is usually used to simplify a specific set of
instructions. We also provide program verification capabilities such
as symbolic execution, calculating the weakest precondition, and
interfacing with decision procedures.  \bap can also write out lifted
\bap instructions as valid C code via the code generator back-end.

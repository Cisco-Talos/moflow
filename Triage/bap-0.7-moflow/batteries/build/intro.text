Welcome to OCaml Batteries Included Beta 1.

Batteries Included is an effort to develop a comprehensive,
decentralized yet unified open-source standard library for OCaml.
For the moment, Batteries Included concentrates on:

{ul
{- {{:Data.html}data structures}}
{- {{:Unix.html}file manipulation and system calls}}
{- {{:IO.html}inputs and outputs}, including {{:Compress.html}(de)compression}}
{- {{:Languages.html}lexing, parsing and pretty-printing}}
{- {{:Threads.html}concurrency}}
{- {{:Numeric.html}numbers}}
{- {{:Text.html}text, including Unicode}}
{- {{:../extensions.html}language extensions}}
{- {{:Compilers.html}OCaml internals} and {{:Util.html}utilities}}
}


Future versions will progressively add (not necessarily in that order):
{ul
{- {{:http://camomile.sourceforge.net/}More Unicode}}
{- {{:http://ocaml-reins.sourceforge.net}More data structures}}
{- {{:http://www.camlcity.org/archive/programming/pxp.html}XML} and {{:http://caml.inria.fr/cgi-bin/hump.en.cgi?contrib=552}JSON}}
{- {{:http://caml.inria.fr/pub/old_caml_site/humps/caml_Graphics_and_GUI_tool_kits.html}User interfaces}}
{- {{:http://ocsigen.org/lwt} More concurrency} and {{:http://cothreads.sourceforge.net/}even more concurrency}}
{- {{:http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/ocamlnet.html}System software and internet protocols}}
{- {{:http://www.cairographics.org/cairo-ocaml/}2d Graphics}}
{- {{:http://www.xs4all.nl/~mmzeeman/ocaml/}Testing}}
{- 3d Graphics}
{- Distributed programming}
{- Cryptography}
{- ...}
}

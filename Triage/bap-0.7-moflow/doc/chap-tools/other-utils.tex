\section{{\tt topredicate}: Predicate-based Program Verification}

{\tt topredicate} supports program verification in two ways. First,
{\tt topredicate} can convert the IL into Dijkstra's Guarded Command
Language (GCL), and calculate the weakest precondition with respect to
GCL programs~\cite{dijkstra:1976}. The weakest precondition for a
program with respect to a predicate $q$ is the most general condition
such that any input satisfying the condition is guaranteed to
terminate (normally) in a state satisfying $q$.  Currently we only
support acyclic programs, i.e., we do not support GCL {\tt while}.

{\tt topredicate} also interfaces with satisfiability modulo theory
(SMT) solvers.  {\tt topredicate} can write out expressions (e.g.,
weakest preconditions) in the CVC Lite~\cite{cvclite},
SMTLIB1~\cite{smtlib1}, and SMTLIB2~\cite{smtlib2} formats, one of which
is supported by virtually all solvers.

\section{{\tt ileval}: Concrete evaluation} 

{\tt ileval} evaluates a given \bil
program using the operational semantics in in~\ref{vine:operational}.
The evaluator allows us to execute programs without recompiling the IL
back down to assembly. For example, we can test that a raised program
is correct by executing the IL on an input $i$, observing the value $v$,
executing the original binary program on $i$, observing the value
$v'$, and verifying $v = v'$.

\section{\texttt{codegen}: LLVM-based code generation}

\texttt{codegen} converts a \bil program to the LLVM~\cite{llvm} IL,
which can then be converted to native code using LLVM's code
generators.  This may be useful for translating binary code to other
architectures, or for static instrumentation.

%% We don't have a separate toc command anymore

%% \section{{\tt toc}} 

%% {\tt toc} generates valid C code from the IL.  For example, one could
%% use this as a rudimentary decompiler by first raising assembly to
%% \bil, then writing it out as valid C.  The ability to export to C also
%% provides a way to compile \bil programs: the IL is written as C, then
%% compiled with a C compiler.

%% The C code generator implements memories in the IL as arrays.  A {\tt
%%   store} operation is a store on the array, and a {\tt load} is a load
%% from the array.  Thus, C-generated code simulates real memory.  For
%% example, consider a program that is vulnerable to a buffer overflow
%% attack. It is raised to \bil, then written as C and recompiled. An
%% out-of-bound write on the original program will be simulated in the
%% corresponding C array, but will not lead to a real buffer overflow.

This directory contains Piqi-RPC â€”- an RPC-over-HTTP system for Erlang.


Full description and documentation are available at

        http://piqi.org/doc/piqi-rpc


The "examples" directory contains several examples of Piqi-RPC services
implemented in Erlang.


Piqi-RPC has a rebar[1] package. It is maintained in a separate GitHub
repository:

        https://github.com/alavrik/piqi-rpc


The easiest way to build and install Piqi-RPC is to use the rebar package. This
way, all dependencies will be installed automatically.

To build Piqi-RPC from sources, install the prerequisites (see below) and run
"make" in the current directory.

PREREQUISITES
=============

Piqi-RPC depends on several open-source components. They need to be installed
before building or running Piqi-RPC.


* Webmachine

        HTTP library for writing well-behaving HTTP services. It works on top of
        Mochiweb.

        Homepage: http://webmachine.basho.com/
        Source code: http://github.com/basho/webmachine


* Mochiweb (it is used by Webmachine)

        HTTP server for Erlang

        Source code: http://github.com/mochi/mochiweb


The easiest and the most reliable way to install both is to download Webmachine
and follow its installation instructions.

Once installed, make sure that they are added to Erlang code paths. There are
many ways to do that, one of them is to set the "ERL_LIBS" environment variable:

        export ERL_LIBS="<path-to-your-webmachine-directory>:$ERL_LIBS"

% This is an extension for addressbook.proto.piqi module.
%
% This file will be automatically included by "piqic ocaml" when it loads
% addressbook.proto.piqi
%
% After converting addressbook.proto to addressbook.proto.piqi, we need to add
% "ocaml-name" property for field "type" in "person-phone-name" record. This is
% necessary because "type" is a keyword in OCaml.

.include [ .module addressbook ]


.extend [
    .field person-phone-number.type

    .with.ocaml-name "phone_type"
]


.custom-field ocaml-name

\chapter{Formalization of \bil}

At the core of \bap is the \bap intermediate language, called \bil. In
this chapter we present a formalization of \bil. The formalization is
intended to provide an exact description of what we mean by statements
in the IL.

{\it Note:} In our implementation, as discussed elsewhere, there are
actually several IL's.  Throughout this chapter we discuss the IL as
implemented in {\tt ast.ml}.  The other IL's differ in uninteresting
ways and are variants of the IL discussed here. In particular,
developers will be interested in {\tt ssa.ml}, which defines the IL in
SSA form, and also does not allow recursively defined expressions
(i.e., it is an SSA three-address code).  Thus, this chapter can be
viewed as a specification for the actual code.

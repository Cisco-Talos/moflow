Snapshot file is generated by gentrace pintool:

pin -t gentrace.so -snapshot-file "sn.mem" -taint_files i.txt -- ./foo i.txt

After this invocation, sn.mem will contain:
- memory dump of ./foo at the point of exception
- all tainted addresses (byte granularity)
- register values and their taint status

If -taint_files isn't enabled, snapshot will not contain any taint info.

Format:

$$$ Header:
0   | TAG_START ('SNAP')
4   | version number (1)

$$$ Registers:
0   | TAG_REGS ('REGS')
4   | number of triples
8   | register's id     \
12  | register's value   > repeat for all regs
16  | taint info        /

$$$ Memory taint:
0   | TAG_TAINT ('TMAP')
4   | number of pairs
8   | address       \
12  | taint status  / repeat for all tainted addresses

taint status can be 
- 0xffffffff for mixed taint,
- 0<x<0xffffffff for x'th input byte.

Let b0 be the first byte of a tainted input file. If mem[addr]=b0, then taint
status for addr is 1. On the other hand, if mem[addr]=b0+1, then taint status
for addr is 0xffffffff (b0+1 is tainted, but doesn't come directly from the
source).

$$$ Regions
0   | TAG_REGIONS ('RGNS')
4   | number of regions
8   | low address \
12  | size        / repeat for all regions

Regions' dumps are stored immediately after the region table (in the same order)
one after another, without any markers between them.

Performance tests for serialization and de-serialization of OCaml data
structures to/from Protocol Buffers, JSON, XML and Piq data formats.

The tests are performed on two different objects. The first one is a relatively
small and not very complicated "addressbook.piq". The second one is the expanded
Piqi self-specification which is 10 times as large as the first one and has more
complex structure.

To run the tests:

        make

        ./test

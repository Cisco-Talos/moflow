Compile complex piqi specification "piqi/piqi.piqi" to produce OCaml
parsers and generators.

Then build a program which reads and writes back a serialized binary object
which happens to be a serialized "piqi.piqi" specification.

Also testing piqi imports in OCaml by compiling and linking "piqobj.piqi" which
imports "piqi.piqi".

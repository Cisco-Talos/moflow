This file contains general instructions for building Piqi from source code.

The following files contain more specific information:

        INSTALL.erlang -- building and installing Piqi for Erlang

        INSTALL.ocaml -- building and installing Piqi for OCaml

        piqi-rpc/README -- building and installing Piqi-RPC

        INSTALL.windows -- building Piqi on Windows


SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
===================

Piqi has been tested on Linux (Debian Lenny and Squeeze, i386 and amd64
architectures) and on Mac OS X 10.6.4. It is also known to work on Windows and
Solaris.

Piqi is written in OCaml so, in theory, it should work on platforms and hardware
architectures supported by OCaml. See the list of supported platforms at:

        http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/portability.en.html

The rest of this file describes the process of building Piqi on Unix platforms.


PREREQUISITES
=============

On Debian (>= Squeeze):

        apt-get install ocaml camlp4-extra ocaml-findlib gcc make sed


On Mac OS X (using Homebrew):

        brew install objective-caml opam
        opam init
        eval `opam config env`
        opam install ocamlfind

        (Here, we used [OPAM](http://opam.ocamlpro.com/) to build and install
        ocamlfind).


On other Unix systems:

        * OCaml compiler and standard library

                Recommended (tested) versions are 3.11.2 and 3.12.0. Older OCaml
                versions >= 3.10 may work as well.

                OCaml is available in most Linux distributions. It can also be
                downloaded from here:

                        http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html

        * CamlP4 -- Caml Preprocessor and Pretty Printer

                It comes as a part of OCaml source distribution. It should be
                prepackaged in major Linux distributions as well.

        * Ocamlfind/Findlib -- library manager for OCaml

                If installed separately form prepackaged OCaml distribution, it
                is recommended to build it from sources after you build/install
                OCaml. It can be downloaded from here:

                        http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html
        * C compiler

                GCC works. Other compilers should work if they are able to build
                OCaml.

        * GNU make, sed and probably some other tools.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

1. Run ./configure

        Run "./configure --help" for the list of available options.

2. Build third-party dependencies

        make deps

3. Build Piqi

        make

4. Install "piqi" and "piqic" binaries (optional)

        make install


RUNNING TESTS
=============

1. Prepare the environment

        . setenv.sh

2. Run the tests

        cd tests; make


See tests/README for further information.

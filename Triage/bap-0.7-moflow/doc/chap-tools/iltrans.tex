\section{\texttt{iltrans}: Programs Transformations on \bil Code}
The {\tt iltrans} tool applies transformations and analyses to \bil.
The arguments to {\tt iltrans} specify a sequence of transformations,
optionally printing out the result of the transformation.  For
example, executing:
\begin{verbatim}
 iltrans -trans1 -trans2 outfile -trans3 infile
\end{verbatim}
would read in {\tt infile}, perform transformation {\tt trans1}, the
output of which is fed to {\tt trans2}, the output of which is again
fed to {\tt trans3} as well as printed to {\tt outfile}. Although this
may seem a little strange at first, the tool is designed to make it
easy to specify exactly what algorithms you wish to perform over the
IL.


{\tt iltrans} provides a library of common analyses and utilities,
which can be used as building blocks for more advanced analyses.
Please consult {\tt iltrans -help} for exact arguments.  We detail
below at a high level several of the analysis that can be performed by
{\tt iltrans}


% \paragraph{Type Checker.
% \item {\bf Type checker.}  The \bap IL serves both as an intermediate
%   representation for assembly and as a programming language that
%   assembly-like programs can be written in.  However, the \bap IL
%   syntax from Figure~\ref{vine:syntax} permits several undefined
%   operations.  For example, the syntax allows adding two variables of
%   different types. The \bap type-checker further restricts the
%   language by removing obviously meaningless statements, as well as
%   catching several typical bugs. The \bap type-checking is not
%   designed to ensure safety (preservation + progress) of a
%   type-checked program. Chapter~\ref{vine:typecheck} details \bap
%   type-checking.


\paragraph{Graphs.} {\tt iltrans} provides options for building and
manipulating control flow graphs (CFG), including a pretty-printer for
the graphviz DOT graph language~\cite{graphviz:dot}. {\tt iltrans}
also provides options for building data, control, and program
dependence graphs~\cite{muchnick:1997}.  These graphs can be output in
the {\tt dot} language.  The graphs themselves can be quite large.  We
currently use {\tt zgrviewer}~\cite{zgrviewer} for viewing the
resulting dot files.


One issue when constructing  graphs of an assembly program is
determining the successors of jumps to computed values, called {\it
  indirect} jumps.  Resolving indirect jumps usually involves a program
analysis that require a CFG, e.g., VSA~\cite{balakrishnan:2007}. Thus,
there is a potential circular dependency.  Note that an indirect jump
may potentially go anywhere, including the heap or code that has not
been previously disassembled.

Our solution is to designate a special node as a successor of
unresolved indirect jump targets in the CFG.  We provide this so an
analysis that depends on a correct CFG can recognize that we do not
know the subsequent state. For example, a data-flow analysis could
widen all facts to the lattice bottom.  Most normal analyses will
first run an indirect jump resolution analysis in order to build a
more precise CFG that resolves indirect jumps to a list of possible
jump targets.  %% {\tt iltrans} provides one such analysis, called Value Set
%% Analysis~\cite{balakrishnan:2007}.

\paragraph{Single Static Assignment.} {\tt iltrans} supports
conversion to and from single static assignment (SSA)
form~\cite{muchnick:1997}. SSA form makes writing an analysis easier
because every variable is defined statically only once.  Note we
convert both memory and scalars to SSA form. We convert memories so
that an analysis can syntactically distinguish between memories before
and after a write operation instead of requiring the analysis itself
to maintain similar bookkeeping. For example, in the memory
normalization example in Figure~\ref{vine:normalized}, an analysis can
syntactically distinguish between the memory state before the write on
line 1, the write on line 5, and the read on line 7.

\paragraph{Chopping.}  Given a source and sink node, a program
chop~\cite{jackson:1994} is a graph showing the statements that cause
definitions of the source to affect uses of the sink.  For example,
chopping can be used to restrict subsequent analyses to only a portion
of code relevant to a given source and sink instead of the whole
program. %% We describe our implementation of chopping in more detail
%% in~\ref{algs:chopping}.

\paragraph{Data-flow and Optimizations.} {\tt iltrans} interfaces with
the generic data-flow engine in \bap.  The data-flow engine works on
user-defined lattices, such as those for constant propagation, dead
code elimination, etc.  \bap currently implements
Simpson's global value numbering~\cite{simpson:1996}, (aggressive)
dead-code elimination~\cite{muchnick:1997}, and live-variable
analysis~\cite{muchnick:1997}.

We have also implemented value set
analysis~\cite{balakrishnan:2007}. Value set analysis is a data-flow
analysis that over-approximates the values for each variable at each
program point. Value-set analysis can be used to help resolve indirect
jumps. It can also be used as an alias analysis.  Two memory accesses
are potentially aliased if the intersection of their value sets is
non-empty.


Optimizations are useful for simplifying or speeding up subsequent
analyses. For example, we have found that the time for the decision
procedure STP to return a satisfying answer for a query can be cut in
half by first using program optimization to simplify the
query~\cite{brumley:2008}.

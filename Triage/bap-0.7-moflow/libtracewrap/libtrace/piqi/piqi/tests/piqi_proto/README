You need to have a Protobuf source distribution for this test. It can be
downloaded from here:
http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/detail?name=protobuf-2.3.0.tar.gz

After downloading and unpacking, create the following symlink before running the
test script:

ln -s <protobuf source directory>/src/google .

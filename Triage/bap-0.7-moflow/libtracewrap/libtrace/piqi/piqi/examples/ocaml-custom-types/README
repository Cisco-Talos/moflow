This is an example of how to serialize arbitrary monomorphic OCaml types by
mapping them to built-in or previously defined Piqi types.

This mechanism can be used, for example, for serializing OCaml chars as
integers, bigints as decimal strings, or even "string Map.Make(String).t" as
list of {key, value} records.

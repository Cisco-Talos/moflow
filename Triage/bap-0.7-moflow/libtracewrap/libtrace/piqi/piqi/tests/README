Piqi tests
==========

To build, run and re-run the tests:

1. Setup the environment

    cd ..
    . setenv.sh
    cd -


2. Run the tests

    make


3. (optional) Run Erlang tests

    make erlang

    NOTE: Erlang tests depend on Piqi runtime library, which can be built by
    running "make erlang" command from the top-level directory.


Prerequisites
=============

Most of the tests require Google Protocol Buffers (>= 2.3.0). It can be
downloaded from here:

    http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/list

"boot_proto2piqi" and "cpp" tests require Protocol Buffers headers and .so
libraries. If they are installed to a non-standard path, use "export CXXFLAGS=
-I <headers path> -L <library path>" command to specify their locations. For
example, if Protobuf is installed to "/opt/local", the command will be:

    export CXXFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include/ -L/opt/local/lib"

"piqi_proto" test requires access to Protobuf source directory. See
piqi_proto/README for details.

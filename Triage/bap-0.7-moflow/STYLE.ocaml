Style guidelines for our ocaml code


We will use http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/guides/guidelines.en.html
with the following clarifications/changes:

* Keep the "in" keyword aligned either vertically or horizontally with its
  corresponding "let" or "and". This makes it easier to visually match them up.
* Keep the "and" keyword aligned with it's corresponding "let".
* Don't indent after "in".

Eg:
  let foo = bar in

Eg2:
  let foo =
    bar
    baz
  in
  quux

Eg3:
  let foo = bar
  and baz = quux in


BadEg1:
-  let foo =
-    bar in


* Don't put a space between a constructor and it's parethesized arguments.
    This is not mentioned in the regular guidelines, and goes against the
    examples, but it makes some sense, since unlike a function, a constructor
    is not valid without it's arguments.

Eg:
  let x = Foo(bar, baz, quux) in
  let y = Bar x in
  let z = Baz(f x) in

***Pattern matching***:

* Give each pattern a line of it's own, unless they all fit on one line.
* Prefix the first pattern with the optional "|", and start it on the line after
  "with", unless all the patterns and their expressions can fit on the same line
   as the "with".
* If the expression for all the cases fit on the same line as their pattern,
  that is ok, otherwise they should all start on the next line.

Eg:
  match foo with
  | Bar -> ...
  | Baz -> ...

Eg2:
  match foo bar baz with
  | Bar ->
       ...
  | Baz ->
       ...

Eg3:
  match foo bar baz
  with
  | Bar -> ...
  | Baz -> ...

Eg4:
  try
    foo;
    bar;
    baz
  with Foo -> foo
 
BadEg:
-  match foo 
-   bar baz with
-    | Bar ->
-       ...
-    | Baz -> ...



*** Other notes***:

* Prefer parentheses over begin/end.    
* Prefer "ignore" over "let _".
* Since we no longer indent after "in", use ";" rather than "let () = ... in"
* Don't explicitly ascribe types that could be infered. It makes the code
  harder to change later.
* Don't overparenthesize unless there is some possible way it may be ambiguous.

*** Editors ***:

Emacs:
Install tuareg-mode, and use
(custom-set-variables
	'(tuareg-in-indent 0)
	'(tuareg-with-indent 0))
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

Note: Comments in ocaml start with a (* and end with a *) and can
contain nested comments. Apparently this is too complicated for emacs'
comment-region, which does retarded things instead, as it tries to
individually comment each line and escape internal comments.

Vim:
Someone who uses vim please update this.
